## Business Problem, Opportunity, and Impact
### Overview of industry, business, or problem
While the stigma around mental health has decreased over the years, many providers have seen a spike in cases related to “diseases of despair.”  These include anxiety and depression, which often go untreated or lead sufferers to “self-medicate” with substances like drugs and alcohol.  According to the Tufts Medical Center and One Mind at Work, depression alone accounts for about $44 billion in losses to workplace productivity. In 2019, national spending on mental health services totaled $225.1 billion and accounted for 5.5% of all health spending1. Furthermore, approximately 40% of Americans live in a designated mental health provider shortage area, which exacerbates the problem. Across the US, each state has discretionary funding allocated specifically for mental health. Sufficient funds and effective resource allocation are necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues. Mental health issues are pervasive and, now more than ever, need to be better understood to address their causes and impacts in a meaningful way.  

### Define the specific problem that should be solved
How to identify individuals, based on self-administered substance use, demographics, and geographic information from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), who are more susceptible to mental health issues? 
Identify who reported “All of the time” or “Most of the time” to any of these questions (see below) on the NSDUH survey:
      During the past 30 days:
      * How often did you feel nervous?
      * How often did you feel hopeless?
      * How often did you feel restless or fidgety?
      * How often did you feel so sad/depressed that nothing could cheer you up?
      * How often did you feel that everything was an effort?
      * How often did you feel down on yourself, no good or worthless?
      * How to answer the question: 

## Why does this problem matter?
Adequate funding is a key factor in most leading implementation science frameworks. According to the American Psychiatric Association (APA)2, one in two Americans will have mental health conditions in their lifetime. When untreated, mental health challenges can have a negative effect on a person's economic solvency, leading to increased rates of homelessness and poverty, social isolation, deteriorating physical health and shorter life expectancy, and decreased profitability for employers and their shareholders due to lower employee efficiency.  Not only that, suicide rates are increasing in all age groups, yet, federal funding for mental health comprises less than 7% of the total U.S. health care spending.2  If we could identify the type of population who is more likely to struggle from mental health issues and identify features/variables features that we could potentially use to provide insights in terms of where the funding for mental health services should be distributed. 

## Potential Audience
According to the World Health Organization, the mechanisms for funding mental health services can be complex, involving allocation from national, state, and local governments as well as from trade unions, voluntary organizations, and donor agencies.3  The federal government, stakeholders within states, and large institutions such as national banks should be one of the most interested audiences because the federal government is a major funding stream for mental health services. The federal government also provides Mental Health Block Grants that support states in building out their community mental health services. State funding is also funneled to county and local levels where services are offered.
